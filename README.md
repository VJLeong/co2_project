#  Automated Compensation of Environmental Changes on CO2 Gas Sensor Response
Project Supervisor: Dr. Ajay Achath Mohanan <br>
Project Members: Leong Van Jun, Vincent Law Yun Kae <br>
Project Commence Date: November 2024 - Present <br>
## Project Description <br>
The main objective of the project is to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) and/or machine learning (ML) tools to assist in analysing patterns in obtained carbon dioxide sensor readings and filtering of unwanted noises. <br>
This objective is achieved through proper setting up of the hardware setup and environment of the carbon dioxide sensor. Which is achieved by constructing of appropriate PCB and testing through external microcontroller units. <br>
For this project, the microcontroller unit used is the PSoC 5LP module and PCB design software used is Kicad 8.
